## Troubleshooting

**Can't find "New" button?**
- Go directly to: github.com/new

**File upload not working?**
- Use "Create new file" instead
- Copy/paste content manually

**Pages option missing?**
- Repository must be PUBLIC
- Check repository settings

**Website shows 404?**
- File must be named exactly `index.html`
- Wait 10-15 minutes for deployment
- Check repository is public

**Still not working?**
- Try different browser
- Clear cache
- Make sure logged into GitHub

The website file is ready and working - it just needs to be properly uploaded to GitHub.
