# GitHub Pages Troubleshooting Guide

## Common Issues and Solutions

### Issue 1: Repository Not Found or Created
**Problem**: Can't find the "New" button or repository creation page
**Solution**:
1. Make sure you're logged into GitHub.com
2. Go directly to: https://github.com/new
3. If still having issues, try logging out and back in

### Issue 2: File Upload Not Working
**Problem**: Can't upload files or drag-and-drop isn't working
**Solution**:
1. Try the alternative method: Click "Create new file" instead
2. Name the file `index.html`
3. Copy the entire content from the `index.html` file in this project
4. Paste it into the GitHub editor
5. Scroll down and click "Commit changes"

### Issue 3: GitHub Pages Not Enabling
**Problem**: Can't find Pages settings or it's not working
**Solution**:
1. Make sure repository is PUBLIC (private repos need paid plan)
2. Go to repository Settings (tab at top)
3. Scroll down to "Pages" in left sidebar
4. If you don't see "Pages", your repo might be private

### Issue 4: Website Not Loading After Setup
**Problem**: Getting 404 error or blank page
**Solutions**:
- Wait 10-15 minutes (GitHub Pages takes time to deploy)
- Check the file is named exactly `index.html` (not `index.html.txt`)
- Verify repository is public
- Check Pages settings show green checkmark

## Step-by-Step Alternative Method

### Method 1: Direct File Creation
1. Go to your repository
2. Click "Create new file"
3. Type `index.html` as filename
4. Copy content from the `index.html` file in this project
5. Paste into GitHub editor
6. Click "Commit changes"
7. Go to Settings > Pages
8. Enable Pages with main branch

### Method 2: Copy-Paste Method
If you're having trouble with file uploads:

1. Open the `index.html` file from this project
2. Copy ALL content (Ctrl+A, then Ctrl+C)
3. Go to GitHub repository
4. Click "Create new file"
5. Name: `index.html`
6. Paste content (Ctrl+V)
7. Commit changes

## Verification Steps

After setup, verify:
1. Repository exists and is public
2. File `index.html` is in repository root
3. Pages is enabled in Settings
4. Wait 10 minutes, then visit your URL

## Your Website URL Format
`https://[your-username].github.io/[repository-name]`

Example: If username is "johnsmith" and repo is "my-pocket-buddy-website":
`https://johnsmith.github.io/my-pocket-buddy-website`

## Still Having Issues?

Common fixes:
- Use a different browser
- Clear browser cache
- Make sure you're logged into GitHub
- Try the mobile GitHub app as alternative
- Check repository name doesn't have spaces or special characters

The website file is ready and will work once properly uploaded to GitHub.
